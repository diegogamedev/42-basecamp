# Skills developed:
    ### C
    C is the main language of the basecamp, all the exams and all the projects are done in C, except by Shell00 
    and Shell01, content like variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros are used to create functions or 
    sometimes programs to run on a Unix terminal.
    
    ### Shell
    The first 2 days are focused on learning basic to intermediate shell commands, from creating files to converting 
    numeric bases on shell.
    
    ### Git bash
    Every project is submitted using git, so learn it was also a task during the basecamp.
    
    ### Self-learning 
    42 has no teachers, so all the learning must come from yourself and the others around you, by googling, by empirical 
    knowledge, or by enquiring other students.
    
    ### Teamwork
    Every weekend happens the rush, a optional task to work in random trios, regardless of skill level, to do a full application,
    so for the rush to work out we have to split tasks, discuss methodologies and manage to work as a team to make sure 
    we reach the main goal
    
    ### Time Management and resiliency
    All the projects in the basecamp have no deadline, so time management is actually the greatest challenge to be surpassed,
    also, because of the short time, everything feels like a big marathon, so it's super important to have a good resiliency.
